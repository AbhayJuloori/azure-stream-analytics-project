### Real-Time Data Ingestion & Processing Pipeline with Azure  

This project demonstrates a real-time data pipeline using Microsoft Azure. The key components include:  

- **Azure Event Hub** to receive simulated IoT data.  
- **Azure Stream Analytics (ASA)** to process incoming data.  
- **Power BI** for real-time visualization.  
- **Python Simulator** to generate and send artificial sensor data to Event Hub.  

The data flows from the Python script to Event Hub, then gets processed via ASA, which filters and streams it to Power BI for visualization. Future enhancements include advanced analytics, alerting, and security improvements.
